# D3-challenge

I was able to get my scatter plot to appear, however the state initials are not appearing, but my tooltip identifies the state and population.

I was running into an error on line 148 or 149 where it was not recognizing my data - even after console logging, which shows the data.

Thankful that Javascript tasks are almost complete.
